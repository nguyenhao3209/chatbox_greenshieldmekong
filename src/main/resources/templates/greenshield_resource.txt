company:
GreenShield Mekong is a sustainable craft and green packaging brand established in the heart of Vietnam’s Mekong Delta — a region known for its fertile rivers, diverse ecosystems, and centuries-old craftsmanship. The company was founded with a clear and powerful mission: to transform local water hyacinth and agricultural byproducts into eco-friendly, biodegradable, and high-value packaging products that replace single-use plastics.

Our story began with a deep concern about the environmental impact caused by plastic pollution and the overgrowth of water hyacinth — an invasive plant that clogs rivers and limits waterway traffic. Instead of treating it as waste, GreenShield saw potential. By combining biotechnology, traditional handcraft, and modern design thinking, we created a sustainable model that supports both nature and people.

Our name “GreenShield” represents our purpose: **a shield protecting the environment through green innovation**. We empower local communities, reduce environmental pollution, and export sustainable Vietnamese craftsmanship to the world. Our main markets include Vietnam, Japan, the EU, and eco-conscious partners worldwide.

mission:
Our mission is to transform Vietnam’s natural and agricultural resources — particularly water hyacinth — into sustainable products that protect the planet, empower people, and promote eco-conscious living.

Specific missions include:
1. **Environmental regeneration:** Turn invasive plants into valuable, biodegradable materials that reduce methane emissions and CO₂ equivalent.
2. **Plastic replacement:** Develop innovative, cost-effective packaging that replaces polystyrene, PET, and other single-use plastics.
3. **Community empowerment:** Create fair-wage employment for local artisans, especially women in the Mekong Delta.
4. **Circular economy:** Apply biotechnology and waste-to-value models to ensure every part of the production cycle is reusable or biodegradable.
5. **Cultural preservation:** Keep traditional handcraft alive while modernizing it for global markets.
6. **Sustainable export:** Meet EU “Green Packaging 2026” and other international eco standards for global competitiveness.

materials
GreenShield’s packaging materials are made entirely from natural, biodegradable, and food-safe sources, ensuring both sustainability and consumer safety.

Water Hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes):
A fast-growing aquatic plant native to the Mekong Delta. After being cleaned, sun-dried, and processed into fine fibers, it becomes the main structural material for eco-friendly boxes, coasters, and trays.

Lotus Leaves (Nelumbo nucifera):
Naturally water-resistant and antibacterial, lotus leaves are collected, dried, and pressed into eco plates and food wraps. They provide a smooth surface, subtle aroma, and organic aesthetic.

Food-Safe Bio-Adhesive:
Made from cassava starch and corn extract, this natural glue binds plant fibers without any toxic chemicals. It is fully biodegradable, heat-resistant, and safe for direct food contact.

All GreenShield materials are chemical-free, compostable, and designed to meet future EU Green Packaging standards (2026).
